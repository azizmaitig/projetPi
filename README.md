# 🚗 ParkEase – Intelligent Parking System

ParkEase is an academic project . It provides a **smart, connected parking solution** that integrates **mobile and web applications**, **embedded systems**, **AI-based detection**, and **workflow automation** using **n8n** to enhance urban mobility and parking management.

## 📌 Project Overview

**ParkEase** is designed to:
- Reduce traffic congestion
- Automate the management of parking spaces
- Improve safety and user experience

It combines:
- Online reservation (via web & mobile)
- Real-time space detection using AI
- Embedded devices for access control and environment monitoring
- Automated workflows using n8n
